## Introduction
Welcome to the "Functions and Nested Loops in C" project! In this project, we will explore the concepts of functions and nested loops in the C programming language. Understanding how to use functions and work with nested loops is crucial for writing efficient and well-structured C code.

This readme file will provide you with the necessary information to get started with this project, including prerequisites, an overview of functions and nested loops in C, and some practical examples.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into this project, you should have the following prerequisites in place:

1. A C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC for Linux, MinGW for Windows).
2. A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and compiling C code.
3. Basic knowledge of the C programming language.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your preferred code editor or IDE.
3. Navigate to the project folder.
4. Begin exploring the C code and documentation to learn about functions and nested loops in C.

## Functions in C
Functions in C are blocks of code that can be called multiple times, allowing you to organize your code, improve maintainability, and reduce redundancy. In this project, you will learn how to create, define, and use functions effectively in C programs.

## Nested Loops in C
Nested loops in C refer to the practice of placing one loop inside another. This technique is commonly used to iterate over multi-dimensional arrays or perform repetitive tasks with varying levels of complexity. You will explore how to work with nested loops and their applications in C programming.
